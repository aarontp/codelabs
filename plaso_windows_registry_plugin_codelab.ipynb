    "This lab is for people who want to learn how to write and execute a Plaso plugin in Python.  This tutorial assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "+  You have a functional development environment\n",
    "+  You have used Plaso\n",
    "+  You are familiar with the Python programming language\n",
    "+  You are looking to write a plugin (as an opposed to a parser, which is covered in a [separate codelab](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/code-lab/text-parser))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will teach you how to write a Windows Registry plugin with tests for the Plaso framework.  By the end you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Write a Windows Registry plugin for plaso\n",
    "+ Write unit tests for the plugin\n",
    "+ Run the plugin as part of plaso/log2timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab should take you a couple hours to complete.  Some of this is dependent on strange build issues you might have.  We are not attempting to get you to check in code yet, this is more to demonstrate how a plugin is written. For this to be a checked in plugin you need to write a plugin against a registry key/value that is not already parsed and split the code here into several files (layout explained below).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to writing a Plaso plugin!  From the outside, writing a plugin can be daunting, but once you get your dev environment going, you've fought half the battle.  This code lab features a simple Windows Registry plugin, but the formula can be used for any type of plugins (another codelab will demonstrate a SQLite database plugin and the hope is that with these two codelabs we should have the plugin writing more or less covered). You may also be interested in the text parser codelab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before Starting\n",
    "\n",
    "Get familiar with the [developers guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Developers-Guide) and more specifically the [style guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Style-guide). To make the code easier to maintain we follow a style guide, partially based on the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html) but slightly modified to fit our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also follow a code review process that is discussed on the [code review](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Codereview) site.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an iPython notebook, and if you are not familiar with it then here is the brief introduction. This is basically an iPython shell wrapped up in a pretty GUI (browser window). You can execute any Python code you wish, and quickly go back, edit and re-run code. To run the code, click the window with the code segment and press \"Shift+Enter\", that way you will see that the bracket on the left will change to indicate it has been executed and you may see some output below (if the code segment produced any output).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to make note of is that some of the code segments depend on previous code segments having been executed. So in order for this codelab to work properly you need to execute **EVERY** code segment that is presented here, especially all class declarations and import statements, but to be sure just execute them all [except those explicitly stated as **optional**].\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to make sure your development environment is up-to date. Run the following code snippet (below) by clicking the tab and pressing \"**SHIFT-ENTER**\". If you'll see a printed warning start by upgrading the tool before continuing."

When the filter matches, the registry parser will call the plugin to examine the key. The plugin does not need to define software redirects (like Wow6432, that's done automatically).\n",

If some registry data you're trying to parse can't be readily selected with these filters, adding one is pretty simple, just take a look at the [interface](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/blob/master/plaso/parsers/winreg_plugins/interface.py#L9)"

The former should only be used if you are absolutely sure all the attributes mentioned there are going to be set for each and every event object created. That means that for the vast majority of the formatters the ConditionalEventFormatter should be the formatter of choice.\n",

    "+ **SOURCE_LONG**: Since the category itself is not sufficient to describe the source we have an extra field called SOURCE_LONG that further defines that, for instance a browser history extracted from Chrome browser will have the source short set to WEBHIST, indicating that this comes from a web history, but the SOURCE_LONG contains the text \"Chrome History\", setting that apart from other browsers.\n",

This is just a typical Python formatting string, so all typical [rules](http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatspec) apply. Timestamp, filename/path, username, hostname, etc information is presented in other fields and should not be a part of the message string.\n",
    "+ **FORMAT_STRING_SHORT**: This is only needed when you think that the resulting message string may exceed 80 characters in with and you don't want that to be shorten, as in you don't want the short message string to just contain the first 77 characters of the longer version you can construct your own condensed one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the conditional formatter you need to define the following class constants:\n",

    "+ **FORMAT_STRING_SHORT_PIECES**: Same as the FORMAT_STRING_SHORT except in the same format as FORMAT_STRING_PIECES, that is as a list.\n",
