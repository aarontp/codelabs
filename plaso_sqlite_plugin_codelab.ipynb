      "This lab is for people who want to learn how to write and execute a Plaso plugin in Python.  This tutorial assumes:\n",
      "\n",
      "+  You have a functional development environment\n",
      "+  You have used Plaso\n",
      "+  You are familiar with the Python programming language\n",
      "+  You are looking to write a plugin (as an opposed to a parser, which is covered in a [separate codelab](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/code-lab/text-parser))\n",
      "\n",
      "## Objective\n",
      "\n",
      "This lab will teach you how to write a SQLite database plugin with tests for the Plaso framework.  By the end you will be able to:\n",
      "\n",
      "+ Write a SQLite database plugin for plaso\n",
      "+ Write unit tests for the plugin\n",
      "+ Run the plugin as part of plaso/log2timeline\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expectations\n",
      "\n",
      "This lab should take you a couple hours to complete.  Some of this is dependent entirely on strange build issues you might have.  We are not attempting to get you to check in code yet, this is more to demonstrate how a plugin is written. For this to be a checked in plugin you need to write a plugin against a registry key/value that is not already parsed and split the code here into several files (layout explained below).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to writing a Plaso plugin!  From the outside, writing a plugin can be daunting, but once you get your dev environment going, you've fought half the battle.  This code lab features a simple SQLite database plugin, but the formula can be used for any type of plugins (another codelab will demonstrate a [Windows Registry](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/code-lab/windows-registry-plugin) plugin and the hope is that with these two codelabs we should have the plugin writing more or less covered). You may also be interested in the [text parser codelab](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/code-lab/text-parser).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Before Starting\n",
      "\n",
      "Get familiar with the [developers guide](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer) and more specifically the [style guide](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/style-guide). To make the code easier to maintain we follow a style guide, partially based on the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html) but slightly modified to fit our needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also follow a code review process that is discussed on the [style guide](http://plaso.kiddaland.net/developer/style-guide) site.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an iPython notebook, and if you are not familiar with it then here is the brief introduction. This is basically an iPython shell wrapped up in a pretty GUI (browser window). You can execute any Python code you wish, and quickly go back, edit and re-run code. To run the code, click the window with the code segment and press \"Shift+Enter\", that way you will see that the bracket on the left will change to indicate it has been executed and you may see some output below (if the code segment produced any output).\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to make note of is that some of the code segments depend on previous code segments having been executed. So in order for this codelab to work properly you need to execute **EVERY** code segment that is presented here, especially all class declarations and import statements, but to be sure just execute them all [except those explicitly stated as **optional**].\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it easier to get documentation about various classes we may use in the codelab we'll start with defining a simple function to print out help (so to execute, click the code segment below and press \"SHIFT+ENTER\")."

However, since there are so many SQLite databases out there we need some additional information to determine if this particular plugin should be executed. For that we need a list (actually a frozenset) of the table names that need to be defined in the database for this plugin to be considered.\n",
