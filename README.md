codelabs
========

**VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
The codelabs are ATM **WIP** and have not yet been upgraded to work with the latest
version of plaso (version 1.3). This disclaimer will be removed once they are
working again.

Placeholder for all codelabs used for plaso development.

There will be more text here describing how the codelabs work. Things like:

* How to get started.
* What this is all about.
* Get this to work.

Essentially this repo contains codelabs for people that want to learn
how to develop code for [plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso), whether
those are plugins or parsers.

One good source of information is the [API documentation](http://plaso-api.readthedocs.org)
that can help people understand the required API before developing your own modules.
However it can be quite daunting trying to get through all the API documentation and thus
we created these iPython based codelabs, allowing future developers to see how the API
works interactively and play with getting things to work.

### TL/DR;

Just run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/log2timeline/codelabs.git
$ cd codelabs
$ ipython notebook
```

Open up your web browser and start working on the codelabs.
