    "This lab is for people who want to learn how to write and execute a Plaso parser in Python.  This tutorial assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "+  You have a functional development environment\n",
    "+  You have used Plaso\n",
    "+  You are familiar with the Python programming language\n",
    "+  You are looking to write a parser (as an opposed to a plugin, which is be a separate codelab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will teach you how to write a text parser with tests for the Plaso framework.  by the end you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Write a text parser for a CSV file\n",
    "+ Write a formatter for the events created by the parser\n",
    "+ Write unit tests for the parser\n",
    "+ Run the parser as part of plaso/log2timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab should take you a couple hours to complete.  Some of this is dependent on strange build issues you might have.  We are not attempting to get you to check in code yet, this is to demonstrate how a parser is written. For this to be a checked in parser you need to write a parser against a file that is not already parsed and split the code here into several files (layout explained below).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to writing a Plaso parser!  From the outside, writing a parser can be daunting, but once you get your dev environment going, you've fought half the battle.  This code lab explains how to write a text parser, but the formula can be used for any type. Other codelabs for plugin writing will be available soon as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before Starting\n",
    "\n",
    "Get familiar with the [developers guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Developers-Guide) and more specifically the [style guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Style-guide). To make the code easier to maintain we follow a style guide, partially based on the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html) but slightly modified to fit our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also follow a code review process that is discussed on the [code review](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Codereview) site.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an iPython notebook, and if you are not familiar with it then here is the brief introduction. This is basically an iPython shell wrapped up in a pretty GUI (browser window). You can execute any Python code you wish, and quickly go back, edit and re-run code. To run the code, click the window with the code segment and press \"Shift+Enter\", that way you will see that the bracket on the left will change to indicate it has been executed and you may see some output below (if the code segment produced any output).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to make note of is that some of the code segments depend on previous code segments having been executed. So in order for this codelab to work properly you need to execute **EVERY** code segment that is presented here, especially all class declarations and import statements, but to be sure just execute them all [except those explicitly stated as **optional**].\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to make sure your development environment is up-to date. Run the following code snippet (below) by clicking the tab and pressing \"**SHIFT-ENTER**\". If you'll see a printed warning start by upgrading the tool before continuing."

Timestamp, filename/path, username, hostname, etc information is presented in other fields and should not be a part of the message string.\n",
